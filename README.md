# final_project

THis is our repository to collaborate and get our final underway.

I recommed downloading the github desktop, it is easier to git commit and git push.
Makes it much easier than using the command promt. (its a headache)

When you are about to clone, just choose the option "open with github desktop" and follow the directions.
Choose where you want it to clone and it will open up the github app.

Open up the file from the cloned repository, make any changes and when you save and it will automatically show you what you what)
changes you have made locally. (difference between the main branch(github) and your local branch(pc)).

I recommend using a differnet branch to commit and then merge onto the main branc. 
A branch is bassicaly a copy of the main branch.
This is to avoid any issues( just in case there is code error that causes the files to be corrupted)

Then you proceed to push and you are done!!

It is now in the github repository and everyone will now beable to see what changes you have made.

Let us plan to do a commit everyday and pull before each of our working days so that we have the freshest code possible

:) looking forward to working with yall
